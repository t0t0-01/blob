Rational and quick-witted, Architects pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. But because their minds are never at rest, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them."

                "Architects question everything. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom and other people\u2019s expertise to guide their lives. But ever-skeptical Architects prefer to make their own discoveries. In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren\u2019t afraid to break the rules or risk disapproval \u2013 in fact, they rather enjoy it.",
                "But as anyone with this personality type would tell you, a new idea isn\u2019t worth anything unless it actually works. Architects want to be successful, not just inventive. They bring a single-minded drive to their work, applying the full force of their insight, logic, and willpower. And heaven help anyone who tries to slow them down by enforcing pointless rules or offering poorly thought-out criticism.",
                "This personality type comes with a strong independent streak. Architects don\u2019t mind acting alone, perhaps because they don\u2019t like waiting around for others to catch up with them. They also generally prefer making decisions without asking for anyone else\u2019s input. At times, this lone-wolf behavior can come across as insensitive, as it fails to take into consideration other people\u2019s thoughts, desires, and plans.",
                "It would be a mistake, however, to view Architects as uncaring. Whatever the stereotypes about their stoic intellect, these personalities feel deeply. When things go wrong or when they hurt others, Architects are personally affected and spend much time and energy trying to figure out why things happened the way that they did. They may not always value emotion as a decision-making tool, but they are authentically human."

In school, they may have been called \u201cbookworms\u201d or \u201cnerds.\u201d But rather than taking these labels as insults, many Architects embrace them.

As a result, they may inadvertently come across as rude or even offensive when they\u2019re only trying to be honest.",

Relying on strategy rather than chance, Architects contemplate the strengths and weaknesses of each move before they make it.

                "This doesn\u2019t mean that Logicians are unfeeling. These personalities generally want to offer emotional support to their friends and loved ones, but they don\u2019t necessarily know how. And because they can\u2019t decide on the best, most efficient way to offer support, they may hold off on doing or saying anything at all.",
                "This \u201canalysis paralysis\u201d can affect multiple areas of Logicians\u2019 lives. People with this personality type can overthink even the smallest of decisions. This makes them feel ineffective and stuck, so exhausted by the endless parade of thoughts in their mind that they struggle to get things done.",
                "The good news is that Logicians don\u2019t have to stay stuck for long. Their unique strengths include everything they need to pull themselves out of the ruts that they occasionally fall into. By leveraging their creativity and their open-mindedness, Logicians can reach their full potential \u2013 both as thinkers and as happy, well-rounded people."

Sometimes Debaters even rebel against their own beliefs by arguing the opposing viewpoint \u2013 just to see how the world looks from the other side.",

Debaters enjoy the mental exercise of questioning the prevailing mode of thought, and they take a certain pleasure in uncovering the value of underdogs and outliers. Their active minds can\u2019t help but rethink the things that everyone else takes for granted and push them in clever new directions.",

But they may also be doing their chances of success and happiness more harm than good.",
                "Not every occasion calls for this personality type\u2019s default contrarianism, and most people can only stand to have their beliefs questioned and their feelings brushed aside for so long. As a result, Debaters may find that their quarrelsome fun burns many bridges, often inadvertently.

The good news is that people with this personality type will never lose their sharply nonconformist edge. They can simply use their cognitive flexibility to understand and explore other people\u2019s perspectives, recognizing the value of consideration and compromise alongside logic and progress."

                "The biggest issue Virtuosos are likely to face is that they often act too soon, taking for granted their permissive nature and assuming that others are the same. They\u2019ll be the first to tell an insensitive joke, get overly involved in someone else\u2019s project, roughhouse and play around, or suddenly change their plans because something more interesting came up."

                "Virtuosos will come to learn that many other personality types have much more firmly drawn lines on rules and acceptable behavior than they do \u2013 they don\u2019t want to hear an insensitive joke, and certainly wouldn\u2019t tell one back, and they wouldn\u2019t want to engage in horseplay, even with a willing party. If a situation is already emotionally charged, violating these boundaries can backfire tremendously.",
                "Virtuosos have a particular difficulty in predicting emotions, but this is just a natural extension of their fairness, given how difficult it is to gauge Virtuosos\u2019 emotions and motivations. However, their tendency to explore their relationships through their actions rather than through empathy can lead to some very frustrating situations. People with the Virtuoso personality type struggle with boundaries and guidelines, preferring the freedom to move about and color outside the lines if they need to.",
                "Finding an environment where they can work with good friends who understand their style and unpredictability, combining their creativity, sense of humor and hands-on approach to build practical solutions and things, will give Virtuosos many happy years of building useful boxes \u2013 and admiring them from the outside."

If an audience member is asked to come on stage, Entrepreneurs volunteer \u2013 or volunteer a shy friend.",

Entrepreneurs keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is \u2013 or better yet, to just go out and do it.

They are forced to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire rational stimulus response.",

It certainly isn\u2019t because they aren\u2019t smart, and they can do well, but the regimented, lecturing approach of formal education is just so far from the hands-on learning that Entrepreneurs enjoy. It takes a great deal of maturity to see this process as a necessary means to an end, something that creates more exciting opportunities.",

Entrepreneurs use these observations immediately, calling out the change and asking questions, often with little regard for sensitivity. Entrepreneurs should remember that not everyone wants their secrets and decisions broadcast.",

Making up only four percent of the population, there are just enough Entrepreneurs out there to keep things spicy and competitive, and not so many as to cause a systemic risk.",

Sometimes though, Entertainers may go too far with risky or careless behaviors, and try to bring others along for the ride. People with this personality type are sensitive, and rejecting these pastimes can be taken personally, ending friendships then and there. Entertainers don\u2019t have time to be lectured.",

Where Entertainer personalities falter is in keeping the friends they already have. In their excitement and focus on here and now over history, Entertainers too easily exhaust the adventure one person has to offer, moving on once one person\u2019s novelty has worn off.",
                "This can all give the impression that Entertainers are shallow, pleasure-centric creatures who care little for anyone but themselves. This is a terrible misunderstanding, and far from the truth, but nevertheless makes friendships with Intuitive (N) personality types challenging. Entertainers care sincerely about their friends \u2013 it\u2019s why they put so much effort into coming up with group experiences they believe everyone will enjoy \u2013 and they are deeply distressed by the occasional conflicts that end these relationships.",

Entertainers love touching on intellectual and philosophical subjects, and they seek out a diversity of personality types and perspectives to keep among their friends. But as these friends grind into the details of some esoteric topic about the long-term consequences of faltering European economic output, Entertainers inevitably find their minds wandering, hoping for someone to rush up and say \u201cGuess what just happened!\u201d"
